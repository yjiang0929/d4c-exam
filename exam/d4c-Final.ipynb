      "The action that could upend protections put in place in states across the country as Trump tries to rack up accomplishments in his first 100 days.The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes the president to declare federal lands as monuments and restrict how lands can be used.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke says the order will cover several dozen monuments across the country designated since 1996 that total 100,000 acres or more, including two recent monuments in Utah.The move could also impact one of the newest national monuments in Maine, designated by former President Barack Obama in 2016. Maine's Governor Paul LePage will head to the nation’s capital to testify against the creation of national monuments by the president without state approval.LePage believes Obama violated the Antiquities Act when he approved the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument.Zinke says he'll provide a preliminary review with recommendations in 45 days.\n",

Kennedy School of Government forum on the press and the presidency.Earnest said a stark difference between Trump and Democratic former President Barack Obama is Obama relished the opportunity to marshal facts to make an argument.In contrast, when Trump is under pressure, Earnest said, his instinct is to create a distraction. He said that's what Trump did by accusing Obama of wiretapping his campaign while offering no proof.Earnest said no president has the authority to unilaterally wiretap someone.Earnest said one reaction he's seen to the Trump presidency is a renewed interest in newspapers, television news and other news outlets.He also said that the election of Trump is a reminder that elections matter - a message he said he sometimes had trouble impressing on younger voters.\n",

He said cellphones combined with social media platforms puts intense pressure on reporters to push out every new tidbit of information instantly.Despite the online technology, Earnest said, he still believes it's important to have a daily White House press briefing to let reporters press the administration on the issues of the day.\"There's something that's symbolically important about the briefing - the idea that there is a senior member of the White House staff who the president designates as the person who will every day prepare himself or herself to go out and speak on camera, on the record, and answer any question that any journalist can come up with,\" he said.Earnest was White House press secretary under Obama from 2014 until Trump took office in January.\n",

      "\"President Kennedy called on a new generation of Americans to give their talents to the service of the country,\" Kennedy's daughter, Caroline Kennedy, said in a statement. \"With exceptional dignity and courage, President Obama has carried that torch into our own time, providing young people of all backgrounds with an example they can emulate in their own lives.\" Caroline Kennedy and her son, Jack Schlossberg, will present Obama with the award May 7 at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston. \"Humbled to be recognized by a family with a legacy of service,\" Obama said in his official Twitter account. The award is presented annually by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation to public servants who have made courageous decisions of conscience without regard for the personal or professional consequences. It is named for Kennedy's 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \"Profiles in Courage.\" The book tells the stories of eight U.S. senators who risked their careers by taking principled stands for unpopular positions. \"Faced with unrelenting political opposition, President Obama has embodied the definition of courage that my grandfather cites in the opening lines of 'Profiles in Courage': grace under pressure,\" Schlossberg said. \"Throughout his two terms in office, he represented all Americans with decency, integrity, and an unshakeable commitment to the greater good.\" Obama is being recognized for \"his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage in a new century,\" the foundation said, citing the expansion of health care options for millions, restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba and leadership on an international climate change agreement. The award has been given out annually since 1989. Last year's winner was Democratic Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy. Obama is the third former U.S. president to earn the award, joining Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush. Other winners include U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., former Ukraine President Victor Yushchenko and former U.S. Rep. Carl Elliott Sr., D-Ala.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama firmly defended his decision to cut nearly three decades off convicted leaker Chelsea Manning's prison term Wednesday, arguing in his final White House news conference that the former Army intelligence analyst had served a \"tough prison sentence\" already.\n",

      "Taking questions on many topics two days before his presidency ends, Obama also warned that the \"moment may be passing\" for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, pushing back on criticism over his recent move to put pressure on the Jewish state over settlement-building. Turning his attention to President-elect Donald Trump, Obama said he reserves the right to speak out as ex-president if Trump violates America's \"core values.\"Obama said he granted clemency to Manning because she had gone to trial, taken responsibility for her crime and received a sentence that was harsher than other leakers had received. He emphasized that he had merely commuted her sentence, not granted a pardon, which would have symbolically forgiven her for the crime.\"I feel very comfortable that justice has been served,\" Obama said.Manning was convicted in 2013 of violating the Espionage Act and other crimes for leaking more than 700,000 classified documents while working as an intelligence analyst in Baghdad. Formerly known as Bradley Manning, she declared as transgender after being sentenced to 35 years in prison. She had served more than six years before Obama commuted her sentence on Tuesday, with a release date set for May.\"The notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital, classified information would think that it goes unpunished, I don't think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served,\" Obama said.Obama's defense of controversial decisions came as he prepares to exit the presidency after eight years marked by major victories on health care, the economy and climate change, along with disappointments over his inability to achieve his goals on immigration, gun control and closing the Guantanamo Bay prison. He also wound down wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but wrestled with other security threats posed by the Islamic State group and the Syria civil war he was unable to resolve.Even many of Obama's proudest achievements, like the \"Obamacare\" health care overhaul, stand to be rolled back or undermined by President-elect Donald Trump, a shadow that hangs over Obama's legacy as he leaves office. The formal end comes Friday when Obama and Trump will motorcade together to the Capitol for Trump's swearing-in before Obama, then an ex-president, flies with his family to California for a vacation.Reflecting on his legacy as the first black president, Obama disputed the notion that race relations had worsened. And he dismissed as \"fake news\" the idea that there is widespread voter fraud in the U.S., a notion that Democrats say is used to justify restrictions that make it harder for African-Americans to vote.Appearing one last time in front of the White House seal, Obama said he was \"significantly worried\" that the growth of Jewish settlements in Palestinian territories would \"increasingly make a two-state solution impossible.\" He stood behind his decision to allow a U.N. Security Council resolution to pass criticizing Israel over the settlements, though he conceded Trump might pursue a different approach.\"If you do not have two states, then in some form or fashion you are extending an occupation,\" Obama said.He defended his administration's rapprochement with Cuba and his eleventh-hour move to end the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy that lets any Cuban who makes it to U.S. soil stay and become a legal resident. Ending the visa-free path was the latest development in a warming of relations that has included the easing of the U.S. economic embargo and the restoration of commercial flights between the U.S. and the small island nation.\"That was a carry-over of an old way of thinking that didn't make sense in this day and age, particularly as we're opening up travel between the two countries,\" Obama said of the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy.After leaving office, Obama plans to write a book, raise money to develop his presidential library, and work on a Democratic initiative to prepare for the 2020 round of congressional redistricting. Yet he said he plans to assume a low profile in the months after he leaves office, and to avoid commenting on politics on a daily basis.\"I want to be quiet a little bit, and not hear myself talk so darn much,\" Obama said.Yet he carved out room for potential exceptions. Obama was insistent that he wouldn't stay silent of Trump tried to deport children brought to the U.S. illegally, a group Obama has sought to protect though executive action.\"That would merit me speaking out,\" Obama said.Although Obama had long intended to take one last round of questions before leaving office, White House officials said that in recent days, Obama became intent on using the occasion to draw a symbolic contrast with Trump on issues of accountability and press freedoms. Trump's team has said it's considering changes to the traditional daily press briefing and to the location of news conferences, stoking concerns among journalists that their ability to cover the presidency may be scaled back.Obama alluded to those concerns in his opening remarks, noting the role the press plays in American democracy.\"It doesn't work if we don't have a well-informed citizenry, and you are the conduit,\" Obama said.\n",

      "Jan 20, 2009Dear Barack,Congratulations on becoming our President. You have just begun a fantastic chapter in your life.Very few have had the honor of knowing the responsibility you now feel. Very few know the excitement of the moment and the challenges you will face.There will be trying moments. The critics will rage. Your “friends” will disappoint you. But, you will have an Almighty God to comfort you, a family who loves you, and a country that is pulling for you, including me. No matter what comes, you will be inspired by the character and compassion of the people you now lead.God bless you.Sincerely,[GW]The letter from Clinton to Bush also extols the thrills of the presidency.President Bill Clinton's letter to President-elect George W. Bush in 2001.January 20, 2001Dear George,Today you embark on the greatest venture, with the greatest honor, that can come to an American citizen.Like me, you are especially fortunate to lead our country in a time of profound and largely positive change, when old questions, not just about the role of government, but about the very nature of our nation, must be answered anew.You lead a proud, decent, good people. And from this day you are President of all of us. I salute you and wish you success and much happiness.The burdens you now shoulder are great but often exaggerated. The sheer joy of doing what you believe is right is inexpressible.My prayers are with you and your family. Godspeed.Sincerely, Bill\n",

To show you the Lincoln Bedroom, and the bedrooms that were once ours, to introduce you to all the people—the florists, the grounds-keepers and the butlers—who dedicate themselves to making this historic house a home. The four of us wandered the majestic halls of the house you had no choice but to move in to. When you slid down the banister of the solarium, just as we had done as 8-year-olds and again as 20-year-olds chasing our youth, your joy and laughter were contagious.Those banister-sliding photos were part of the mix, and the joy is indeed infectious: \n",

The trio begin their stroll in the Cross Hall, and meander through the South Portico side of the first floor, then to the East Room, Green Room, Blue Room and Red Room, White House photographer Pete Souza also took to his Instagram account Wednesday, posting a photo of the president giving his final press conference before leaving office.

      "WASHINGTON — Vouching for the successor he never imagined having, President Barack Obama on Monday sought to reassure an anxious nation and world that Donald Trump would maintain America's alliances and its status as the \"indispensable nation.\" He credited the president-elect for tapping into American voters' anxiety and enthusiasm.\"Do I have concerns?\" Obama added. \"Absolutely.\"Speaking at a White House news conference before a three-nation trip that was supposed to be his grand valedictory tour, Obama pointedly refused to criticize Trump, who only a week ago Obama said was \"woefully unprepared for the job\" and couldn't \"handle the nuclear codes.\"Instead, Obama did his best to soothe the pangs of uncertainty at home and abroad after a divisive campaign that included charges of racism, sexism and other offensive rhetoric, and questions from Trump about the validity of the United States' security relationships in Europe and Asia.\"There is enormous continuity ... that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order around the world,\" Obama said. Relationships and policies go beyond presidents, he said, adding that military officials, diplomats and intelligence officers would cooperate with their foreign counterparts as before.In his White House meeting with Trump last week, Obama said the Republican \"expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships,\" including \"strong and robust NATO\" partnerships.It was a sharp change in tone for Obama, who regularly mocked Trump's candidacy in the last days before the election, even accusing the billionaire businessman and former reality television star of helping the Islamic State group with his rhetoric about Muslims and undermining U.S. democracy through his claims of a \"rigged\" election. At the time, almost all polls showed Democrat Hillary Clinton leading Trump.Asked about one of Trump's most contentious moves since his triumph, appointing Steve Bannon as chief strategist and senior adviser, Obama said it was up to the president-elect to appoint a team that will serve him well.\"It takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality,\" Obama said of the choice of Bannon, a man celebrated by the white nationalist movement. Of Trump, Obama said \"it's important for us to let him make his decisions.\" But adding a hint of worry, Obama said he counseled Trump during their White House meeting: \"It's really important to send some signals of unity.\"Whereas Obama hailed Trump's \"impressive\" ability to speak to voters, he also delivered a subtle critique of Clinton's campaign.He said Democrats must broaden their focus beyond just swing states after an election that left the Senate and House in Republican hands, as well as most of the nation's governor's mansions. He rejected the idea that demographic advantages would lead to all-but-assured victories for the party, saying it must rebuild at the local, state and national levels.\"We're going to have to compete everywhere,\" he said, reflecting on his own 2008 win in Iowa, a state that went for Trump this time. \"We're going to have to show up everywhere.\"Clinton kept a relatively light campaign schedule until the final weeks of her campaign, mostly attending smaller events in battleground states. Her campaign focused heavily on motivating the Democratic base of women and minority voters, rather than swaying independents. \"Good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them,\" Obama said.While Obama is in Germany, Greece and Peru, he said his team would accelerate efforts to ensure a smooth transition to the Trump administration.He stressed that he would try to strengthen the American economy over his final two months, so that \"when we turn over the keys, the car's in pretty good shape.\"\n",

      "The White House said Obama called the Republican in the early hours of the morning to congratulate him on his victory in the presidential campaign, which marked a forceful rebuke by voters to Obama's eight years in office. The two leaders planned to meet Thursday at the White House, where Obama was to update Trump about ongoing planning for the transition.Obama was to offer his first reaction to the election later Wednesday in a televised statement that the White House said would focus on \"what steps we can take as a country to come together after this hard-fought election season.\"\"Ensuring a smooth transition of power is one of the top priorities the president identified at the beginning of the year and a meeting with the president-elect is the next step,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement.For Obama, the act of holding the meeting is a humbling blow to Obama's legacy and hopes for leaving a lasting imprint on the nation's policies. Trump has vowed to rip up much of what Obama accomplished, including his signature health care law, the Iran nuclear deal and a painstakingly negotiated trade deal with Asia.Obama also called Hillary Clinton after it became clear she'd lost the race. The White House said Obama had \"expressed admiration for the strong campaign she waged throughout the country.\"It was unclear how substantive Obama's call was with Trump, or how long it lasted, although the White House noted that Obama placed the call from his residence in the White House, rather than from the West Wing. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, described it as a \"very nice talk.\" She said Trump had missed the president's original call as Trump as speaking to supporters in New York, then called him back after leaving the stage.Like Clinton and other Democrats, Obama didn't appear to see Trump's victory coming. As he campaigned vigorously for Clinton in the race's final days, Obama said he was confident that if Americans showed up to vote, they'd choose against electing the billionaire reality TV show with no formal government experience.He had also warned supporters in apocalyptic terms that \"the fate of the republic\" rested on Clinton defeating Trump on Election Day.\n",

The two leaders planned to meet Thursday at the White House, where Obama was to update Trump about ongoing planning for the transition.Obama was to offer his first reaction to the election later Wednesday in a televised statement that the White House said would focus on \"what steps we can take as a country to come together after this hard-fought election season.\"\"Ensuring a smooth transition of power is one of the top priorities the president identified at the beginning of the year and a meeting with the president-elect is the next step,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement.For Obama, the act of holding the meeting is a humbling blow to Obama's legacy and hopes for leaving a lasting imprint on the nation's policies. Trump has vowed to rip up much of what Obama accomplished, including his signature health care law, the Iran nuclear deal and a painstakingly negotiated trade deal with Asia.Obama also called Hillary Clinton after it became clear she'd lost the race. The White House said Obama had \"expressed admiration for the strong campaign she waged throughout the country.\"It was unclear how substantive Obama's call was with Trump, or how long it lasted, although the White House noted that Obama placed the call from his residence in the White House, rather than from the West Wing. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, described it as a \"very nice talk.\" She said Trump had missed the president's original call as Trump as speaking to supporters in New York, then called him back after leaving the stage.Like Clinton and other Democrats, Obama didn't appear to see Trump's victory coming. As he campaigned vigorously for Clinton in the race's final days, Obama said he was confident that if Americans showed up to vote, they'd choose against electing the billionaire reality TV show with no formal government experience.He had also warned supporters in apocalyptic terms that \"the fate of the republic\" rested on Clinton defeating Trump on Election Day.\n",

      "PHILADELPHIA — In the place where America's democracy took root, with tens of thousands shivering in the cold, Barack and Michelle Obama passed the torch Monday to Hillary Clinton in an emotional but anxious plea to elect her president.Though the book won't close on his presidency until Inauguration Day, Obama's frenzied, last-minute push for Clinton was a farewell tour of the nation. As he crisscrossed Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, he waxed nostalgic, told old stories and teared up as he thanked the nation for betting, improbably, on \"a skinny guy with a funny name.\"He said he'd been asked recently whether the hope that defined his campaign had somehow survived eight trying years.\"The answer's yes,\" Obama said in Independence Mall, not far from the Liberty Bell. He said he was still a believer, \"and that's because of you.\"\"In the letters you've written me, in the tears you've shed for a lost loved one, I've seen again and again your goodness and your strength and your heart,\" Obama said.Then the Obamas and the Clintons embraced onstage: The last Democratic president and the current one; the first black president and the woman who, on Tuesday, may break yet another historic barrier.It was left to Michelle Obama, whose visceral speeches this campaign hit a nerve with many Americans, to cast both families as part of a singular American story: One of inclusive opportunity that she hoped would contrast powerfully with the vision of Republican Donald Trump.She said she marveled at a country where \"a girl like me from the South Side of Chicago, whose great-great-grandfather was a slave, can go to some of the finest universities on earth. Where the biracial son of a single mother from Hawaii and the son of a single mother from Hope, Arkansas, can both make it to the White House.\"\"Thank you for welcoming us into your communities, for giving us a chance whether you agreed with our politics or not,\" Mrs. Obama said, in her own send-off to the nation. She said ensuring Clinton wins the election was \"perhaps the last and most important thing that I can do for my country as first lady.\"It wasn't always this way. In 2008, when Obama defeated Clinton in a grinding primary, there was naked bitterness between the two Democrats that only began to soften when Obama named her secretary of state.Nearly a decade later, the Obamas need Clinton as much as she needs them, to prevent their legacy from being eviscerated by a victorious Trump. After all, the president told supporters earlier in Ann Arbor, Michigan, all his accomplishments \"go out the window if we don't win tomorrow.\"Clinton, too, was meditative about the bruising battles that have led her to this moment.\"I regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became,\" Clinton said, without naming Trump. In a less-than-subtle display of political symbolism, she spoke from behind the presidential seal affixed to the podium from which Obama introduced her.The Obamas are keenly aware that whether or not Clinton wins Tuesday, their era is coming to an end, a reality punctuated by both Obamas' insistence that neither will ever run for office again.So in a parting gift to Clinton, Obama offered her his campaign mantra - \"Fired up, ready to go\" - and told rally-goers in New Hampshire how it had been coined by a supporter he'd never met who showed up at an obscure event eight years ago in South Carolina.\"It just goes to show you how one voice can change a room,\" Obama said - and then a city, a state and a nation. \"And if it can change a nation, it can change the world.\"\n",

      "WASHINGTON — Donald Trump inherits a much sturdier economy than the one Barack Obama carried into his second term four years ago. Back then, the scars of the Great Recession were still fresh. Joblessness was near 8 percent. Pay was flat. Europe faced a grave debt crisis that threatened to spread across the Atlantic.\n",

      "Now? The job market, with steady hiring and just 4.9 percent unemployment, has proved durable. Pay is finally accelerating. Auto sales are near a record pace. Housing is stronger. Europe's financial plight has stabilized. Yet the economy's long-standing shift toward workers with college degrees left people without them stuck with dimmer job opportunities and stagnant wages - a trend for which Trump blamed trade deals that he said led manufacturers to move overseas. The Americans who elected Trump are longing not just for change but for a reversal of the Obama era - one that will ignite growth, slash taxes, restore lost factory jobs and curb most federal regulations. Problem is, the economy's most vexing problems - from an aging workforce to listless productivity to weak corporate spending - defy quick fixes. Trump has pledged an economic renaissance yet has avoided the broad policy prescriptions widely seen as necessary for managing a government. Well before the election, Trump's supporters came to distrust government data that pointed to a recovery and to question the interventions by the Federal Reserve to sustain growth. But given his extravagant economic promises, the hotelier, real estate developer and TV celebrity faces an uphill challenge. \"His lack of governing experience, potential difficulties building relationships with congressional leaders and inconsistent policy pronouncements during the race make it hard to predict his policy initiatives or his effectiveness in driving them through Congress,\" Mark Haefele and Thomas McLoughlin of UBS wrote in a note to investors. On the positive side, economists say they see no signs of the financial excesses or stalled consumer spending that often tip economies into recession. Yet with interest rates still near record lows, the Fed has little ammunition left to help should the economy weaken. If things sour, Trump's \"policy options will be constrained, perhaps historically so,\" said Patrick O'Keefe, director of economic research at the consulting firm CohnReznick. Since the recession officially ended in June 2009, growth has averaged a subpar 2.2 percent a year. Yet at 89 months old, this is the fourth-longest of 33 recoveries from recession dating to 1858, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. The Fed has signaled it's confident enough in the economy to resume raising short-term rates at its next meeting in mid-December. Late last year, the Fed raised its benchmark short-term rate from a record low after having kept it there for seven years to help rejuvenate the economy after the recession. It had been expected to follow this year with several more rate increases. But trouble overseas - especially panic over a sharp slowdown in China, the world's No. 2 economy - and a slump in U.S. growth put the central bank on hold. The economy has also been slowed by a strong dollar, which has made U.S. goods costlier overseas. Tepid business investment, partly resulting from cuts in the energy industry in response to low oil prices, has hurt, too. In the meantime, by historical standards, borrowing rates remain extraordinarily low. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.57 percent this week, not much above the record low of 3.31 percent. Many economists think super-low rates will remain in place for years, which is why they fret that there will be little room for the Fed to cut rates further to deliver stimulus in case of a recession. J.P. Morgan pegs the probability of a recession within the next three years at 66 percent. \"The tools that in the past have been used to combat a recession or try to enhance a decelerating economy are already exhausted,\" O'Keefe says. It's possible, of course, that Trump and Congress will agree on some initiative that might help energize the economy - on infrastructure spending, for example, or tax reform. For years, the economy has been hobbled by an older and slower-growing workforce and by lackluster gains in the productivity of its workers. The percentage of adults who either have a job or are looking for one has dropped from 66 percent when the Great Recession hit in December 2007 to 62.8 percent. Retirements by the vast generation of baby boomers are part of the reason. But another factor is that many working-age Americans have been forced to the sidelines as blue-collar factory jobs have vanished. Many other people have left the workforce to go on disability. Productivity - output per hour of work - fell for three straight quarters (for the first time since 1979) before rebounding in the July-September quarter. Rising productivity is vital to raising Americans' living standards because it allows businesses to pay employees more without having to raise prices. The productivity drought is a puzzle to economists. Most had expected technology to speed efficiency. One explanation is that the heart of the economy has been shifting from manufacturing, where automation has produced big productivity gains - to services, where it hasn't. Another view is that America's deteriorating roads, ports and bridges are slowing shipping and commuting times and making the economy less efficient. \"The economic cost is huge to having all those people sitting in cars and airplane tarmacs doing nothing,\" says Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For now, assuming that hiring remains solid with unemployment around historically normal levels, even tepid economic growth should manage to keep raising worker pay over the next couple of years, Harris says. Just don't expect the economy to strengthen. Growth won't likely rise much from its current listless pace of 1.5 percent to 2 percent a year, Harris says. \"There will still be a sense of disappointment in the economy for the average person, because growth isn't going to get any better,\" he says. \"We've got to accept that 2 percent is good growth, not bad growth. That's the norm now.\"\n",

During remarks Friday at the National Rifle Association, the president took aim at the liberal senator once again, saying she could be among the Democrats who seek to challenge him in 2020 if he seeks a second term.\"I have a feeling that in the next election, you're going to be swamped with candidates,\" Trump said. \"It may be Pocahontas, remember that.\"Native American leaders have called Trump's attacks on Warren offensive and distasteful. Some Democrats have called the remark racist.The president has spent months feuding with Warren, an outspoken Wall Street critic who leveled blistering attacks on Trump during the campaign. He seized in particular on questions about her heritage, which surfaced during her 2012 Senate race challenging incumbent Sen. Scott Brown.During that campaign, law school directories from the Association of American Law Schools from 1986 to 1995 surfaced that put Warren on the association's list of \"minority law teachers\" when she was teaching at the University of Texas and the University of Pennsylvania. Warren said she listed herself with Native American heritage because she hoped to meet people with similar roots.In a 2012 interview with The Associated Press, Warren said she and her brothers were told of the family's heritage by their parents, the late Don and Pauline Herring.Brown pressed Warren to release more information about how she described her heritage to potential employers. Warren said she never sought proof of ancestry because she didn't think it was necessary.\n",

      "During the ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House, President Trump singled out several members of the Patriots, including wide receiver Danny Amendola, calling for them to raise a hand or step forward for acknowledgment.Amendola was one of two dozen or more players for the Super Bowl champions who did not attend the event. The Boston Globe reported that 34 players attended the White House event. Amendola posted a photo on his Twitter account showing him working out with the hashtag \"missed the road trip.\"The Patriots said the number of players who attended the White House celebration was in line with previous times they won the Super Bowl. \"The last time the #Patriots won two Super Bowls in three years, 36 players visited the White House. Today, we had 34,\" the team tweeted. One player made an impromptu appearance at a White House press before the official ceremony. Tight end Rob Gronkowski stuck his head in the door of the briefing room as Press Secretary Sean Spicer was holding a televised press briefing.He jokingly asked Spicer whether he needed any help, drawing laughs. Spicer - an avid Patriots fan - responded \"I think I got this. But thank you.\"\n",

      "Trump's welcome to the team was coming hours after the news from Massachusetts prisons officials that ex-Patriot tight end Aaron Hernandez hanged himself in his prison cell.Hernandez, who played for the Patriots from 2010 to 2012, was serving a life sentence for a murder conviction. Days ago, the 27-year-old former tight end was acquitted of a double murder.A team spokesman said the Patriots were aware of the reports of Hernandez's death but that the club wasn't expected to comment.Trump has particularly close ties to the Patriots, counting owner Bob Kraft and coach Bill Belichick as friends. One of Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" hats was spotted in Tom Brady's locker in 2015.Kraft was one of at least seven NFL team owners who gave $1 million each to Trump's inaugural committee, a new fundraising report shows. Others include the owners of the Houston Texans, the Washington Redskins, the Jacksonville Jaguars and the LA Rams. Kraft gave the money via his Kraft Group LLC.After the triumphant victory, tight end Martellus Bennett quickly made it clear he was not coming to the White House and other teammates followed. Many noted their differences with the Republican administration.Defensive back Devin McCourty told Time Magazine that \"I don't feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won't.\"Players have turned down White House invites ever since such events began to take off under President Ronald Reagan. That includes Brady in 2015. He cited a \"family commitment\" at the time, but there was speculation he declined because of some unflattering comments a spokesman for President Barack Obama made about the \"Deflategate\" scandal.The team's White House visit caps a dramatic Super Bowl victory. In the first such game to go to overtime, the Patriots pulled off a stunning rally from 25 points down to beat the Atlanta Falcons.\n",

      "Two days after the U.S. missile strike on a Syrian air base, Democratic lawmakers in the Bay State stopped short of criticizing the president’s decision.“We cannot stand idly by while a brutal dictator uses chemical weapons against innocent civilians,” Rep. Seth Moulton, of Salem, said. Moulton told a crowd of constituents gathered for a town hall in Lynn that the situation in Syria was in the forefront of everyone’s mind.Moulton, an Iraq War veteran and member of the House Armed Services Committee, said he believes the president's order in this case was legal.However, he said any future U.S. attacks in Syria would require first going to Congress.“It seems that this initial strike, according to what the president has said, was just in response to the chemical weapons attack. But if intends to put any troops on the ground, if he intends to have a larger air campaign or anything else in Syria that clearly is a conversation that needs to happen with Congress,” Moulton told reporters.Moulton said he also plans to seek a re-vote on a resolution passed by Congress in the days after Sept. 11, 2001, which presidents have since used as the legal basis for a variety of executive actions.Sen. Ed Markey said he and other Democrats will demand a debate in Congress on what Markey said is an escalating situation that could lead to war with Syria's main backer.“The more bombing there is the more potential there will be for the United States and Russia to be in a military conflict,” Markey said.He called on Trump to use diplomacy and not to enter another ground war in the Middle East.Among a handful of vocal Trump supporters who turned out for the town hall in Lynn, Diana Ploss said the missile attack showed \"courage\" on the part of the president.“We don't have all the information and we never will. We won't know why he did what he did. But I feel like I trust him enough at this point,” she said.\n",

      "Syria condemned the strike as an \"aggression,\" while the Syrian opposition welcomed military action against President Bashar al-Assad after a chemical attack earlier this week killed over 80.The bombing represents President Donald Trump's most dramatic military order since taking office and thrusts the U.S. administration deeper into the complex Syrian conflict. The Obama administration threatened to attack Assad's forces after previous chemical attacks, but never followed through. Trump called on \"all civilized nations\" to join the U.S. in seeking an end to the carnage in Syria.Rep. Joe Kennedy released a statement critical of Trump for not consulting members of Congress before launching the airstrikes.Sen. Elizabeth Warren had a similar response, saying Trump, “owes the American people an explanation of his strategy. We should not escalate this conflict without clear goals and a plan to achieve them.\"     Warren and Kennedy condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria. But Warren blasted the White House for not embracing people fleeing conditions in that country.  Rep. Seth Moulton was blunt on that point. He tweeted, \"So @POTUS cares enough about the Syrian people to launch 50 Tomahawks but not enough to let the victims of Assad find refuge & freedom here.\"A protest is already planned for Friday in Cambridge, calling for a diplomatic solution to the conflict. About 60 U.S. Tomahawk missiles hit the Shayrat air base, southeast of Homs, a small installation with two runways, where aircraft often take off to bomb targets in northern and central Syria. The U.S. missiles hit at 3:45 a.m. (0045 GMT) Friday morning and targeted the base's airstrips, hangars, control tower and ammunition areas, U.S. officials said. They were fired from two warships in the Mediterranean Sea, in retaliation for Tuesday's deadly chemical attack, which officials said used chlorine mixed with a nerve agent, possibly sarin. The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin believes the U.S. strike is an \"aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law.\" Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in Friday's statement carried by Russian news agencies that Putin believes the U.S. launched the strikes under a \"far-fetched pretext.\" \"Washington's move deals a significant blow to the Russia-U.S. relations, which are already in a deplorable shape,\" Peskov said. He added that the attack creates a \"serious obstacle\" for creating an international coalition against terrorism. Russia's Foreign Ministry later said it is suspending a memorandum with Washington - signed after Russia began an air campaign in support of Assad in September 2015 - under which the two countries exchange information about sorties over Syria. A U.S.-led coalition has been bombing Islamic State targets in Syria since 2014, while Russia's air force has been striking both extremist groups and Syrian rebels in order to aid Assad's forces.\n",

      "President Donald Trump says strike on Syria in the 'vital national security interest' of the United States.More than 50 Tomahawk missiles were fired at Shayrat Air Base in Homs Province -- this is the base where the plane took off from that dropped the chemical weapons in Idlib Province.   The officials say that multiple targets were struck at the base. Syrian state TV reports US missile attack on number of military targets, calls the attack an \"aggression\"The strikes occurred between 8:40 p.m. and 8:50 p.m. ET,  or 3:40 a.m. and 3:50 a.m. Syrian time.  Trump calls on 'civilized nations' to join U.S. in 'seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria'The United States blasted a Syrian air base with a barrage of cruise missiles Thursday night in fiery retaliation for this week's gruesome chemical weapons attack against civilians. President Donald Trump cast the U.S. assault as vital to deter future use of poison gas and called on other nations to join in seeking \"to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria.\"It was the first direct American assault on the Syrian government and Trump's most dramatic military order since becoming president just over two months ago. Announcing the assault from his Florida resort, Trump said there was no doubt Syrian President Bashar Assad was responsible for the chemical attack, which he said employed banned gases and killed dozens.\n",

      " \"Assad choked out the lives of innocent men, women and children,\" Trump declared. The U.S. strikes hit the government-controlled Shayrat air base in central Syria, where U.S. officials say the Syrian military planes that dropped the chemicals had taken off. The U.S. missiles hit at 8:45 p.m. in Washington, 3:45 a.m. Friday morning in Syria. The missiles targeted the base's airstrips, hangars, control tower and ammunition areas, officials said. Syrian state TV reported a U.S. missile attack on a number of military targets and called the attack an \"aggression.\" The surprise U.S. assault marked a striking reversal for Trump, who warned as a candidate against the U.S. getting pulled into the Syrian civil war, now in its seventh year. But the president earlier in the week appeared moved by the photos of children killed in the chemical attack, calling it a \"disgrace to humanity\" that crossed \"a lot of lines.\" About 60 U.S. Tomahawk missiles, fired from warships in the Mediterranean Sea, targeted an air base in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack that American officials believe Syrian government aircraft launched with a nerve agent, possibly sarin.\n",

      " The president did not announce the attacks in advance, though he and other national security officials ratcheted up their warnings to the Syrian government throughout the day Thursday. \"I think what happened in Syria is one of the truly egregious crimes and shouldn't have happened and it shouldn't be allowed to happen,\" Trump told reporters traveling on Air Force One to Florida, where he was holding a two-day summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.The strike came as Trump was hosting Xi in meetings focused in part on another pressing U.S. security dilemma: North Korea's nuclear program.  Trump's actions in Syria could signal to China that the new president isn't afraid of unilateral military steps. even if key nations like China are standing in the way.Trump has advocated greater counterterrorism cooperation with Russia, Assad's most powerful military backer. Just last week, the Trump administration signaled the U.S. was no longer interested in trying to push Assad from power over his direction of a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and led to the worst refugee crisis since World War II. U.S. military officials sought to portray the strikes as an appropriate, measured response. But the assault still risks plunging America into the middle of Syria's conflict, complicating the safety of the hundreds of U.S. forces fighting a separate campaign against the Islamic State group in the north of the country. If Assad's military persists in further gas attacks, the Trump administration might logically pursue increased retaliation.\n",

      " Russia and Iran, Assad's allies, pose other problems. Russian military personnel and aircraft are embedded with Syria's, and Iranian troops and paramilitary forces are also on the ground helping Assad fight the array of opposition groups hoping to topple him.Before the strikes, U.S. military officials said they informed their Russian counterparts of the impending attack. The goal was to avoid any accident involving Russian forces. Nevertheless, Russia's Deputy U.N. ambassador Vladimir Safronkov warned that any negative consequences from the strikes would be on the \"shoulders of those who initiated such a doubtful and tragic enterprise.\" The U.S. also notified its partner countries in the region prior to launching the strikes. Trump's decision to attack Syria came three-and-a-half years after President Barack Obama threatened Assad with military action after an earlier chemical weapons attack killed hundreds outside of Damascus. Obama had declared the use of such weapons a \"red line.\" At the time, several American ships in the Mediterranean were poised to launch missiles, only for Obama to abruptly pull back after key U.S. ally Britain and the U.S. Congress balked at his plan. He opted instead for a Russian-backed plan that was supposed to remove and eliminate Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles. Thursday night's strikes were launched from the USS Ross and USS Porter and landed in the early morning Friday in Syria.\n",

      " The world learned of the chemical attack earlier in the week in footage that showed people dying in the streets and bodies of children stacked in piles. The international outcry fueled an emotional response from Trump, who appeared to abandon his much-touted \"America First\" vision for a stance of humanitarian intervention, akin to that of previous American leaders. \"I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity,\" he said Thursday. Trump seemed to rapidly reconsider his feelings about Assad, saying: \"He's there and I guess he's running things, so something should happen.\" The show of force in Syria raises legal questions. It's unclear what authority Trump is relying on to attack another government. When Obama intervened in Libya in 2011, he used a U.N. Security Council mandate and NATO's overall leadership of the mission to argue that he had legal authority - arguments that many Republicans opposed. Trump can't rely on either justification here. Unclear also is whether Trump is adopting any broader effort to combat Assad. Under Obama, the United States largely pulled back from its support for so-called \"moderate\" rebels when Russia's military intervention in September 2015 led them to suffer a series of battlefield defeats. Instead, Obama sought to work with Russia on a negotiated transition. Trump and his top aides had acknowledged in recent days the \"reality\" of Assad being in power, saying his ouster was no longer a priority. But the chemical weapons attack seemed to spur a rethink. In Florida on Thursday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said of Assad: \"There's no role for him to govern the Syrian people.\"\n",

      "CAMBRIDGE — In its Monday, April 3 meeting, the Cambridge City Council is scheduled to vote on a resolution put forward by Vice Mayor Marc McGovern, Councilor Jan Devereux and Councilor Leland Cheung calling for the U.S. House of Representatives to begin an impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump.\n",

      "Wicked Local reports the resolution was put forward with help from the Cambridge Area Stronger Together organization, known by the acronym CAST.The resolution states that the way the president controls the Trump Organization has constituted a violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution “from the day he took office.”The clause stipulates that “no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.”An “emolument” is a salary, a fee or a profit.Trump announced in January he was transferring control of his business empire to his adult sons, but he still maintained a direct tie to the company through a trust. Trump is the sole beneficiary of the trust and can revoke it at any time.Richard W. Painter, who was the lead White House ethics attorney for President George W. Bush, is among a group that days after Trump was inaugurated filed a lawsuit alleging he was violating the Constitution by allowing his businesses to accept payments from foreign governments.The lawsuit claims the emoluments clause prohibits Trump from receiving money from diplomats for stays at his hotels or foreign governments for leases of office space in his buildings. The lawsuit is pending in the Southern District of New York.“On Jan. 11, 2017, nine days before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump announced a plan that would, if carried out, remove him from day-to-day operations of his businesses, but not eliminate any of the ongoing flow of emoluments from foreign governments, state governments, or the United States government,” the City Council resolution reads.“These violations undermine the integrity of the presidency, corruptly advance the personal wealth of the president, and violate the public trust,” the resolution adds.Material from The Associated Press was used in this report.\n",

      "It began with FBI director James Comey notifying Congress of an official investigation into ties between Trump’s campaign and the Russians –-, ostensibly regarding collusion to influence the 2016 election. In between, his sensational accusation of wiretapping by President Obama was roundly dismissed as a lie without proof, and the week ended with Trump’s crushing failure to advance the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act. Had the health care bill passed, the president would have claimed victory and celebrated his No. 1 objective.  But most of America would not have joined him.A Quinnipiac poll showed just 17 percent approval for the repeal plan. Fully 85 percent deem it \"very important\" for health insurance to be affordable.   Those numbers don’t suggest, by any means, that the ACA is perfect.   It isn’t.  There is obviously work to be done and compromises forged.Democrats and Republicans alike agree.   Repeal and replace was doomed and the president received a major lesson about how different it is to be a CEO in the public sector. Having suffered a humiliating loss of his long-stated goal to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare, it is time for Trump to keep the third part of his pledge -- to make American health care “something great.”We sincerely doubt he has the humility, let alone the ability, to make such a deal with Congress, but we hope this lesson spurs constructive dialogue. Improving the ACA would be a far more progressive –- and appropriate goal for everyone involved. And its success would make for a truly good week for a lot of people.\n",

      "ATLANTA — Americans who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act are feeling some relief at the failure of Republican efforts to repeal it, but they face new anxieties with President Donald Trump tweeting that \"ObamaCare will explode.\" Premiums have risen and major insurers have backed out of the state markets where people can buy insurance online under Obama's signature health care law. But people who say it saved their lives or helped them start a business want lawmakers to fix these problems, not encourage them. \"It does need its fixes, I totally see that,\" said Inge Hafkemeyer, 57, who credits the law's subsidies for containing her costs as her home-based event-planning business took off in Mission, Kansas, a Kansas City suburb. \"But if your roof leaks, you don't burn down the house to fix it.\" Clare Schexnyder, 49, is convinced she's alive today because of it. As a small business owner in Decatur, Georgia, she couldn't afford health insurance until the rollout in 2013. She began getting mammograms, and her breast cancer was spotted in time. Her double mastectomy and reconstruction surgery was priced at $250,000, but she paid no more than her $6,200 annual deductible. Then, her daughter spent a week in the hospital after her appendix burst, costing them another $6,200. They took out a second mortgage to pay the bills. \"An appendectomy shouldn't have to make me refinance my house,\" she said. \"It's still not a perfect system by any means, but I'm glad we have it.\" Schexnyder's insurer pulled out of the Affordable Care Act last year, leaving fewer alternatives in Georgia, one of the states that refused to set up insurance exchanges or participate in Medicaid expansion. But she objects to tweets like this one Trump sent on Saturday: \"ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry.\" \"They're setting it up to fail, which is irresponsible and unforgiveable,\" Schexnyder said. Shannon Henson, a 49-year-old unemployed conference planner in the Kansas City suburb of Independence, Missouri, said the Affordable Care Act has been a good starting point. \"It wasn't going to be perfect from the get-go,\" she said. Republican promises to repeal and replace the law foundered on Friday when House Speaker Paul Ryan abruptly pulled the party's health care bill to avoid almost certain defeat. \"We're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future,\" Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters. The law has covered more than 20 million people who were previously uninsured through private insurance sold on the law's marketplaces and by expanding Medicaid, the health program designed to help poor Americans. It required insurers to cover \"essential\" services, including mammograms, and barred them from refusing policies to the very sick or others with pre-existing health conditions. But premiums jumped by double digits this year as the cost of medical care and prescription drugs continues to soar, and the marketplaces created by the law are short on the healthy consumers who make insurance companies profitable. In about one-third of U.S. counties, consumers in the individual markets don't have a choice of plans. Mina Viladas, 53, of Fairfield, Connecticut, said she was covered under the Affordable Care Act when she needed emergency surgery. But the self-employed fitness trainer said the insurance plans are getting more expensive. \"The Democrats need to work on improving it, with the Republicans, if possible,\" she said. \"But I'm happy it's still where it is because it's saved me.\"\n",

      "The protests come less than 24 hours after the president and congressional Republicans failed to pass a GOP-backed new health care plan. About four dozen Trump supporters gathered on the Paul Revere Mall in the North End.Many of them were draped in American flags and carrying signs that read, “Make America Great Again.”Mark Van Gordon, who organized the Boston demonstration on Facebook, said several similar events were taking place nationwide to honor veterans, first responders and the president.Van Gordon and other Trump supporters said they were undeterred by Friday’s defeat of a Republican bill that would have repealed much of the Affordable Care Act passed under former President Barack Obama.“I don’t agree it was taken off the table. But I know Trump is coming back with another plan. He always does. He doesn’t give up,” Van Gordon said.Trump stoked such hopes earlier in the day by tweeting, “ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!”Asked what they consider the president’s biggest accomplishment so far since being elected, some of his supporters at the march hesitated.“I know the travel ban didn't go well.  But I'm hoping that will eventually,” Gail Gregory said.Lauren Rogers said she remains hopeful about the president’s promise to increase the number of jobs in the U.S.“I think he’s serious about putting Americans first, for all Americans, not just a certain few,” she said.Meanwhile – a smaller group of about dozen Trump opponents stood by.Many of them had their faces covered and waved flags from the former Soviet Union.They sang the Internationale, the world communist anthem, and mocked the defeat of the Republican health care plan.“If you go across the border in Canada, they're not having this kind of debate in Washington about who should not have healthcare,” said Trump opponent John Harris.As the two groups marched from the North End to Boston Common, police on bicycles kept them separated.When they arrived on the Common, the chants and taunts continued for about 45 minutes.Eventually, the Trump supporters sang the national anthem and both groups dispersed.Boston police reported no arrests.\n",

They claim they're going to move on to tax code, tax issues, We will see. They're going to have the same problem with the tax code that they had with healthcare, maybe more,\" Capuano said. \"I want President Trump to be a successful president,\" Capuano said. \"There's no benefit to America to have a president who can't get anything done. At the same time, that doesn't mean I want him to get his way. I want him to understand that America is built on building consensus.\"\n",

      "Sen. Linda Dorcena Forry, a black Haitian-American who lives in Dorchester, set the tone in welcoming Republican Gov. Charlie Baker and noting that she had not invited Trump.\"We're just going to stick with the one token Republican this year,\" said Forry, the host. \"Ironically, I used to be the token at this breakfast.\"Forry mocked Trump's Twitter obsession with her own fake tweet from the president, holding up a sign that read, \"Good Luck on yur STUDID breakfast SAD!!\"The governor's devotion to the Republican Party was also a topic, with Forry telling him, \"you know you're not really a Republican\" and at another point calling Baker \"the least favorite governor at the White House.\"Baker fed into that thread with his post-election video dubbed \"a bipartisan love story\" that strung together photos of the governor smiling and laughing with the state's top Democrats as Barbara Streisand sang longingly about memories.Attorney General Maura Healey tweaked legislative leaders for the hefty pay raises they approved for themselves this year, displaying House Speaker Robert DeLeo and Senate President Stan Rosenberg riding in \"tricked out Mercedes.\"\"I thought they told you not to spend that pay raise all in one place,\" Healey said.Boston Mayor Marty Walsh also capitalized on the raises. \"What I do love is when elected officials take a stand,\" Walsh quipped. Singling out Forry and South Boston Rep. Nick Collins, he said, \"They are profiles in courage. I mean voting for your own pay raise, on a roll call. That takes a lot of guts.\"Collins jabbed back at Walsh, of Dorchester, for shortening the route of this year's parade in South Boston.\"Remember that year when Mayor Flynn, a Southie guy, decided to shorten the Dorchester Day Parade?\" Collins said. \"Me neither. Never happened.\"Sen. Elizabeth Warren kept up her focus on the president, describing the Irish as \"the immigrants Donald Trump likes.\"Referring to the Patriots come-from-behind Super Bowl win in February over the Atlanta Falcons, Warren said, \"Wasn't it great to see a victory that wasn't decided by the Russians?\" She added, \"I am still amazed by Julian Edelman's catch. Those are big hands. Not tiny little presidential hands.\"She wrapped it up with: \"Any minute the president will declare that when you're famous you can grab someone by the blarney stones.\"Sen. Edward Markey also targeted Trump. \"It's hard to measure the historic mean-spiritedness of this administration,\" he said. \"Saint Patrick was famous for driving the snakes out of Ireland and unfortunately they seem to have all landed jobs inside the White House.\"Baker, regretting his resemblance to villainous NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, recalled being mistaken for him by Pats fans at the Super Bowl parade.\"The boos start raining down,\" the governor said. \"This is no joke. So I looked out and I said 'Hey, wait a minute. I'm not Roger Goodell. I'm the governor.' And they booed even louder.\"Several speakers riffed off of Trump's orders aimed at blocking entrance into the U.S. of foreign nationals from six majority-Muslim countries.Congressman Stephen Lynch said he was \"worried sick\" that his Irish mother-in-law, who lives with him, might be deported.\"It would be so easy for the authorities to pick her up any weekday Monday through Friday at 6:07 p.m. when she gets off the bus at - the Number 9 bus, at G and Broadway,\" Lynch said.Breaking into song, Lynch spoofed on Walsh's invitation for undocumented immigrants to stay at City Hall. \"Got no visa,\" he sang. \"Have some pizza.\"To the tune of \"Beauty and the Beast's\" song \"Be Our Guest\" he added:\"If you're human,just join the unionand you'll find a welcome here;Better yet,from Tibet,just no cheering for the Jets;Know the Red Sox starting lineup,that's our test.\"Walsh said he was supposed to visit Ireland this year for St. Patrick's Day.\"I was going to go over and go back to the homeland,\" he said. \"But I had to cancel my trip because I wasn't sure that immigration would let me back in the country.\"Healey joked about running for governor against Baker next year and the fact that Baker didn't vote for a presidential candidate.\"I backed Hillary,\" Healey said. \"He was backed into a corner.\"\n",

    "<b>A.</b> Using the Jeopardy data from question 3, perform a logistic regression to determine whether or not a player wins the game based on either first break scores, or end of round1 scores. \n",
    "Create an ROC curve for this logistic regression and give a personal opinion (backed up by the curve and its sensitivity/recall) about how good the logistic regression is. What would you recommend as a score threshold for the best prediction as to 'whether a player will win the game or not'?\n",

    "<b>B.</b> The problem in part A is a subtle variation on a more traditional logistic regression problem. If two players both have scores of $20,000 at the end of the first round, the statistics indicate that they are both likely to win. However, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcLjcSloXs\" target=\"_blank\">there can be only one</a>. Does looking at the differences in player scores improve your ability to make a definitive statement about the game? (\"Yes that person will definitely win\" or \"It's anyone's game\")\n"
